# Lost In Translation Assingment

We have built an online sign language translator as a Single Page Application using the React framework.

**Tools**
Visual Studio Code, 
railway.app

## Webpage ##

### Login Page ###
On this side the user can login with a name of their liking.

When the user clicks on the Continue Arrow, they will be routed to the Translation Page.

### Translation Page ###
On this side the user can type a word they want to translate.

When the user clicks on the Continue Arrow, the word they typed will be translated to American sign language.


### Profile page ###

On this page, the user's ten last translations will be displayed. If the user don't have any translations, they will see a message saying: "You have no translations yet". This message will also show if the user cleares their translation history with the "clear history button". If the user clicks on the clear history button they need to confirm an erase of previous translations through a prompt. It is also possible for the user to logout, through a simple log out button.

#### Navbar ####
You can use the navbar to move back and forth to the translation and profile page.
